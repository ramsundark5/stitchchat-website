<p>Stitchchat ("Stitchchat" or "we" or "us" or "our" or other similar pronouns) offers you ("you" or "your") calling and text messaging services through Stitchchat’s licensed software application ("Licensed Application") for mobile devices available on Stitchchat’s website at <a href="http://Stitchchat.info/">www.Stitchchat.info</a> ("Site") or other third party websites. The Site, the Licensed Application and the various Stitchchat services offered to you may be collectively referred to in these terms as the "Service". You understand that, just like a regular mobile phone service, anyone with knowledge of your phone number may call you or send you messages through our Licensed Application. Our Licensed Application is licensed, not sold, to you for use only under the terms of this license, unless a product or service is accompanied by a separate license agreement, in which case the terms of that separate license agreement will govern, subject to your prior acceptance of that separate license agreement. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you. This license is a binding legal document between Stitchchat and you and explains your rights and obligations as a user of the Service ("License"). By using the Service you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this License, the <a href="privacy.html">Stitchchat Privacy Policy</a> and the Stitchchat <a href="dmca.html">DMCA Policy</a>, all of which are incorporated by herein by reference. If you choose to not agree with any of these terms, you may not use the Service.</p>
<p>CHECK RESTRICTIONS ON USE: In some countries there are restrictions on the use of the Licensed Application. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to use Stitchchat where you are located.</p>
<div class="subTitle"><strong>1. Scope of License</strong></div>
<p>This License is a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Licensed Application on any mobile device or personal computer that you own or control. You may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple mobile devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (unless the foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law, or permitted by the licensing terms governing the use of any open sourced components of the Licensed Application, if any). In addition, any commercial copying or distribution, publication or exploitation of the Site, or any content, software, code, data or materials on or from the Site, are strictly prohibited unless you have received express prior written permission from us or the applicable rights holder. Any attempt to do so is a violation of our rights. If you breach these restrictions, you may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the License will govern any upgrades provided by us that replace and/or supplement our Service, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.</p>
<div class="subTitle"><strong>2. Consent to Use of Data</strong></div>
<p>How Stitchchat receives, collects and uses information about you from your use of the Service in general, including Personal Information, is more fully described in the <a href="privacy.html">Stitchchat Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>By using the Licensed Application, you understand and agree that we may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about your mobile device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application. We may use this information to improve our Service.</p>
<div class="subTitle"><strong>3. Changes to this License</strong></div>
<p>Stitchchat may make changes to the terms of this License from time to time. Stitchchat will publish the changes at <a href="eula.html">http://www.eula.Stitchchat.info</a>. The changes will be effective when published. Please review this License on a regular basis. You understand and agree that your acceptance of the terms of this License or your use of the Service after the date of publication of varied terms shall constitute your agreement to the updated terms. If you do not agree with the amended terms, you may terminate your relationship with Stitchchat in accordance with paragraph 4 below.</p>
<div class="subTopic"><strong>4. Termination</strong></div>
<p><strong>4.1</strong> The License is effective until terminated by you or us. You may terminate your relationship with Stitchchat at any time. If you are using our free Service, you may simply cease to use the Service or delete our Licensed Application. If you registered for our "Stitchchat Out" service (described below), you can request that Stitchchat delete your User Account (as defined below). Stitchchat has the right to terminate your rights under this License without notice if you fail to comply with any terms of this License. Upon termination of the License, you shall cease all use of the Licensed Application, and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Licensed Application.</p>
<p><strong>4.2</strong> In addition, Stitchchat has the right to terminate its relationship with you, or may terminate or suspend your use of the Service at any time:</p>
<p class="subSubTitle"><strong>4.2.1</strong> if you are in breach of the terms of this License;</p>
<p class="subSubTitle"><strong>4.2.2</strong> if Stitchchat reasonably suspects that you are using the Service to break the law or infringe third party rights;</p>
<p class="subSubTitle"><strong>4.2.3</strong> if Stitchchat reasonably suspects that you are trying to unfairly exploit or misuse any of our policies;</p>
<p class="subSubTitle"><strong>4.2.4</strong> if Stitchchat reasonably suspects that you are using any of our products fraudulently or that your "User Account" is being used by a third party fraudulently;</p>

<p><strong>4.3</strong> Stitchchat shall effect such termination by preventing your access to the Service, where applicable. We reserve the right to cancel User Accounts that have been inactive for more than one (1) year.</p>
<div class="subTopic"><strong>5. The Service</strong></div>
<p><strong>5.1</strong> Once you have downloaded the Licensed Application and become a Stitchchat user, you can call any other Stitchchat user for free. In addition, Stitchchat offers you the opportunity to become a premium "Stitchchat Out" user, which allows you to call non-Stitchchat users around the world at the rates set forth in paragraph 10 below. In addition, you are allowing certain incoming calls generated outside the Stitchchat network, by your friends or other people calling your number, to be received by your mobile device or desktop through the Licensed Application (hereinafter: "Stitchchat In"). "Stitchchat In" is provided to you for free and you may disable the 'Stitchchat In' service at any time by changing the application settings. </p>
<p><strong>5.2</strong> The Service also allows users to submit status text, photos, videos and other communications (collectively, the "User Submissions"). These User Submissions may be hosted, shared, and/or published as part of the Service, and may be visible to other users of the Service who have your mobile phone number in their mobile phone and which you have not blocked. You acknowledge and agree that any of your User Submissions may be viewed by other users that have your mobile phone number. You retain your ownership rights in your User Submissions. You understand that whether or not such User Submissions are published, Stitchchat does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any User Submissions. You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. User Submissions do not necessarily represent the views or opinions of Stitchchat, and Stitchchat makes no guarantees as to the validity, accuracy or legal status of any User Submission. In connection with your User Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Stitchchat to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to your User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Service and this License; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each identifiable individual person referenced in your User Submission to use their name and likeness in your User Submission. Please note, by submitting the User Submissions to Stitchchat, you hereby grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicense able and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform your User Submissions in connection with the Service and Stitchchat’s (and its successor's) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant every user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your User Submissions through the Service. You further agree that you will not violate any of the restrictions listed in Prohibited Uses set forth in paragraph 6.2 below. Stitchchat does not endorse any User Submissions or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and we expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with User Submissions. Stitchchat does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights via its Service, and we will remove all content and User Submissions if properly notified that such content or User Submission infringes on another's intellectual property rights. To file a copyright infringement notification to us, please follow the instructions at our Stitchchat <a href="dmca.html">DMCA Policy</a>.</p>
